R code for a basic fantasy football EDA
Hi! I created this code for a blog post that can be found at https://annafellars.github.io/annablog/blog/fantasy-football-real-statistics/

Notes: If you are following along in my blog, your graphs will look different than mine as the ffoportunities package will be updated with more game data! Because of this, you will probably want to adjust the colors as I hard-coded them in for the data I was working with.
